# To do list - React

## Description:
The application I created allows you to make your own to-do list. Sample tasks can be downloaded by clicking on the "Pobierz przykładowe zadania" button. Added tasks can be marked as completed by clicking the green button. The appearance of the "✓" sign and the task crossed out means that the task has been correctly added to the completed list. By clicking the "Ukończ wszystkie" button, all tasks in the list will be marked as completed, which can then be hidden with the "Ukryj ukończone" button. If you want to see the hidden tasks again, click the "Pokaż ukończone" button. Deleting a particular task is done by using the red button. The application also allows you to filter tasks in the "Filtruj zadania" field and view the details of the task after clicking on it. To be redirected to the information about the author, click on the "O autorze" field.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
